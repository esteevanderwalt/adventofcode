# Part 1 was very straightforward. For part 2, I took the approach of just printing an ASCII art 
# visualisation of the robots' positions to the terminal after each movement. But that took too 
# long to check, and without knowing exactly what I was looking for, I kept fooling myself into 
# thinking a vague assortment of dots looked kind of like the outline of a Christmas tree and 
# submitting wrong answers. Eventually I noticed that there were two kinds of "special" patterns 
# which kept showing up, one where most of the robots were in a certain horizontal segment of the 
# grid, and one where most of the robots were in a certain vertical segment of the grid. I also 
# noticed that these special patterns appeared at regular intervals, e.g. the vertical pattern 
# appeared when the step number was 70 mod 101. So, guessing that the vertical one might eventually 
# turn into a Christmas tree, I altered the code to only show the vertical patterns, and that allowed 
# me to get to the Christmas tree picture after examining a reasonably small amount of pictures.
