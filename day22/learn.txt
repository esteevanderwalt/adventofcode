Running in 0.84s wiht Python3.13. Paralelization was leading nowhere in this problem. 
so I switched instead to vectorization using numpy. It's just like matlab days!

I first build all secret numbers of all buyers using just one matrix op. Then I make diffs, build the diff into 4- sequences, 
and these are transformed into numbers in base 19. I add an extra "digit" in base 19 corresponding to the buyer. 
This is a large matrix ,19**4 * len(buyers), but numpy makes easy of this matrix. 
Using unique I can discard further appearances of repeated sequences, at the end all that's left is 
multiplying by values and finding the max. 
I'm sure there's lot of space for improvement by numpy gurus.
