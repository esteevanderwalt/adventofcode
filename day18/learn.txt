Just a simple BFS through the grid for part 1, and then in part 2, straight binary search for the index at which the BFS fails.

Binary search is known to cause me a lot of off-by-ones because my brain can't math 
(this does not bode well for the remaining day problems :D), so I just break out of it once there's at most 3 elements left to test and test them one by one, 
but otherwise everything has been out of the algorithms textbook.

Did part 1 using regular dijsktra, then realised that I could reduce the runtime for part 2 by breaking from dijkstra as soon as the end point was reached. 
First tried linear search (brute force) for part 2 then implemented binary search
