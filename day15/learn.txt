Problem with our solution compared to _b solution....

Comparison of Logic
The working solution builds chains explicitly:

When moving in a specific direction, it builds a chain of all connected boxes in that direction (starting with the robot).
It then checks if this chain can move as a whole before performing the movement.
This avoids intermediate states where only part of the chain moves, preventing errors in logic.
Our implementation pushes boxes incrementally:

The push_box function moves boxes one step at a time.
It does not inherently recognize or handle chains of boxes as a unit, leading to inconsistencies.
Issues in Our Implementation
Problem: push_box is not chain-aware
The push_box function processes a single box or a series of adjacent boxes but doesn't consider them as a unified chain.
When boxes collide with walls or other boxes, the function doesn't halt as expected. Instead, it tries to move individual boxes separately.
Problem: Movement order
The robot moves independently, while the boxes move afterward. This separation means the robot may "outpace" or "misalign" itself relative to boxes in certain configurations.
