Uses DP to fill out table of fewest presses for any leg of any keyboard. 
I figured between each key you should either move horizontally then vertically, or vise versa. 
Didn't know which so I just try both.

Neat check for avoiding robot panic: don't move horizontally first if (xf, yi) == KEY_COORDS[' '], 
and don't move vertically first if (xi, yf) == KEY_COORDS[' ']

technically you're sharing your input here, which Eric asks us not to so you might want to see if you can scrub that. Neat solution though!

The input in the snippet is the sample from the problem statement. That's fine to share, right?
Thanks for the shout either way

Oh.. well haven't paid enough attention then, big sorry for that. 
I know that having a copy of the puzzle text is also not really liked, 
but I guess sample inputs alone shouldn't be of any harm... not 100% sure though :D
